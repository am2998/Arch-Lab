# ZFS Assistant Codebase Reorganization - Summary

## Overview

The ZFS Assistant codebase has been reorganized from a flat structure into a modular, package-based architecture. This reorganization improves maintainability, readability, and separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Logical Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `core/` | Core ZFS operations (dataset management, snapshots) |
| `backup/` | Backup and restore functionality (send/receive) |
| `system/` | System integration (pacman hooks, systemd timers) and maintenance |
| `ui/` | User interface components |
| `utils/` | Common utilities, models, logging |

### 2. UI Reorganization

The UI components have been further organized into:

- `ui/windows/` - Main application windows
- `ui/dialogs/` - Modal dialog windows
- `ui/settings/` - Settings-related UI components
- `ui/components/` - Reusable UI components

### 3. Detailed Changes

1. **Core Module:**
   - Moved `zfs_core.py` to `core/zfs_core.py`
   - Updated imports to use relative paths

2. **Backup Module:**
   - Moved `zfs_backup.py` to `backup/zfs_backup.py`
   - Updated imports to use relative paths

3. **System Module:**
   - Moved `system_integration.py` to `system/system_integration.py`
   - Moved `system_maintenance.py` to `system/system_maintenance.py`
   - Updated imports to use relative paths

4. **Utils Module:**
   - Moved `common.py` to `utils/common.py`
   - Moved `logger.py` to `utils/logger.py`
   - Moved `models.py` to `utils/models.py`
   - Moved `privilege_manager.py` to `utils/privilege_manager.py`

5. **UI Module:**
   - Previously reorganized the UI files with a similar structure
   - Updated all imports to reflect new organization

6. **Import Updates:**
   - Updated imports in all files to reflect the new structure
   - Modified `zfs_assistant.py` to use the new import paths
   - Updated `application.py` and `__main__.py` with new import paths

7. **Package Files:**
   - Created `__init__.py` files in each directory to make them proper Python packages
   - Configured exports in `__init__.py` files to simplify imports

8. **Setup.py:**
   - Updated to use `find_packages()` to automatically find the new package structure

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Each module has a clear responsibility
2. **Better Maintainability:** Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
3. **Improved Organization:** Logical grouping of related functionality
4. **Easier Navigation:** Clear folder structure makes finding code easier
5. **Proper Python Packaging:** Using standard Python package conventions

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application to ensure it works with the new structure
2. **Documentation:** Update any remaining documentation to reflect the new structure
3. **Ongoing Improvements:** Continue to refactor and improve code within each module
